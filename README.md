# Uptick
This is a social media project developed for CS-151 between members Rafael Jimenez, Simon Truong, and William Tran. The project requires the group members to make a social media platform that mimics features from popular social media platform Reddit. This project will have three phases of development, with each phase gradually adding more features and functionality in the platform's functions such as leaving feedback or a providing form of positive reinforcement to a post. This project shall be developed in Java and JavaFX/Swing, and UML diagrams will be used to streamline the creation and planning process. This repository was created by Simon Truong, and the other members Rafael Jimenez and William Tran are added as collaborators to the repository to contribute towards the project.
